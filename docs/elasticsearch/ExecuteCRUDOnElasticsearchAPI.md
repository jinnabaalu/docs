# ‚úçÔ∏è CRUD Operations in Action

#### Create Index

> **Without mappings:** Elasticsearch auto-generates field types when you index the first document (dynamic mapping).  
> **With mappings:** You define field types up front for better control (e.g., setting text vs keyword).

To create an index with mappings:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/ramayana_characters -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "name": { "type": "text" },
      "description": { "type": "text" }
    }
  }
}'
```
**OUTPUT**
```bash
{"acknowledged":true,"shards_acknowledged":true,"index":"ramayana_characters"}
```

##### Insert Document

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9200/ramayana_characters/_doc -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "name": "Rama",
  "description": "Hero of the Ramayana, seventh avatar of Vishnu."
}'
```

**OUTPUT**
```bash
{"_index":"ramayana_characters","_id":"_g1qMpYBhtVSA9-yauE0","_version":1,"result":"created","_shards":{"total":2,"successful":1,"failed":0},"_seq_no":0,"_primary_term":1}
```

> üîë COPY ID FROM ABOVE OUTPUT "_id": "_g1qMpYBhtVSA9-yauE0" FOR NEXT QUERIES

##### üîç Query the Cluster - Select All

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200/ramayana_characters/_search?pretty'
```

**OUTPUT**
```bash
{
  "took" : 154,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "ramayana_characters",
        "_id" : "_g1qMpYBhtVSA9-yauE0",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Rama",
          "description" : "Hero of the Ramayana, seventh avatar of Vishnu."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Select by ID
> Replace the ID from the previous OUTPUTS


```bash
export DOC_ID=_g1qMpYBhtVSA9-yauE0;
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/ramayana_characters/_doc/${DOC_ID}?pretty"
```

**OUTPUT**
```bash
{
  "_index" : "ramayana_characters",
  "_id" : "_g1qMpYBhtVSA9-yauE0",
  "_version" : 2,
  "_seq_no" : 1,
  "_primary_term" : 1,
  "found" : true,
  "_source" : {
    "name" : "Raama",
    "description" : "Hero of the Ramayana, seventh avatar of Vishnu."
  }
}
```

##### Update Document
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/ramayana_characters/_update/${DOC_ID}?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "doc": {
    "name": "Raama"
  }
}'
```

**OUTPUT**
```bash
{
  "_index" : "ramayana_characters",
  "_id" : "_g1qMpYBhtVSA9-yauE0",
  "_version" : 2,
  "result" : "noop",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 0,
    "successful" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 1,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```

Try the GET call again to see the updated value.

##### Delete Document

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9200/ramayana_characters/_doc/${DOC_ID}?pretty"
```

**OUTPUT**
```bash
{
  "_index" : "ramayana_characters",
  "_id" : "_g1qMpYBhtVSA9-yauE0",
  "_version" : 3,
  "result" : "deleted",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 2,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```

## üß† Homework 

üì• **Create & Query**: Index documents, fetch them, and analyze the JSON response  
üß¨ **Understand Mappings**: Play with auto-mapping vs custom mappings  
üü° **Why Yellow?**: Dig into replica shards and discover why the cluster health may show as yellow
