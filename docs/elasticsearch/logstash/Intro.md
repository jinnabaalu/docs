# 🛡️ Compliance Driven Pipeline Design

1. Encrypting PII in Logstash 
2. Masking PII
3. Secure Data Transfer

PII Masking Pipeline
    Remove or obfuscate personally identifiable info.
Field-Level Encryption Pipeline
    Encrypt sensitive fields before indexing.

Access Auditing Pipeline
    Track access to sensitive data (logs about the logs).
    Use: SOC 2, ISO 27001
    How:
        Send audit logs to a separate index with restricted access.
        Use Beats → Logstash → audit index.
Anonymization Pipeline
    Purpose: Replace values with non-identifiable pseudonyms.
    Use: R&D logs or GDPR pseudonymization
    How:
    

# 🫧 Elastic Stack Operations

### Production-Proof Elasticsearch
#### My Hands-On Journey from Dev Mode to Production-Grade Infra

This is my real-world Elasticsearch journey — from basic CRUD operations to building secure, scalable,production-grade clusters, and observability instrumentation.

### Key Areas of Focus:
1. **Single Node Cluster Setup**: Documenting my setup of an Elasticsearch single-node cluster.
2. **Logstash with Kibana for ETL**: Configuring Logstash pipelines to integrate PostgreSQL data into Elasticsearch with Kibana as the front end.
3. **Enabling XPack**: How I enabled XPack features for security, monitoring, and alerting.
4. **Basic High Availability (HA)**: Setting up a highly available Elasticsearch cluster for production use.
5. **Data Masking for Security Compliance**: Using Logstash to mask sensitive data to comply with standards like GDPR, SOC2, PCI DSS, PIPEDA, etc.
6. **Dataviews in Elasticsearch**: Creating Dataviews for Elasticsearch indices to enhance the flexibility of data exploration.
7. **Real-Time Dashboard Creation**: Designing and deploying dashboards for real-time monitoring using Kibana.
8. **Alerting**: Setting up alerting systems based on query results and Elasticsearch monitoring data.
9. **Observability**: Understanding and implementing observability with the ELK stack, utilizing Beats and other agents.
10. **Beats and Agents**: A deep dive into Beats (Filebeat, Metricbeat, etc.) and agents for collecting and shipping logs and metrics to Elasticsearch.

### Additional Activities I’ve Worked On:
- [Generate XPack Certs](./CertificateGenerator.md): Step-by-step guide for generating XPack certificates.
- [Run Single Node Docker Container](./SingleNodeDocker.md): Setting up Elasticsearch as a containerized application.
- **Elasticsearch as a Container**: Containerization of Elasticsearch for development and production environments.
- **Logstash Pipelines**: Best practices and configurations for setting up efficient Logstash pipelines.
- **Kibana Configurations**: Tailoring Kibana dashboards and settings to optimize user experience.
- **Observability with ELK**: Exploring how ELK stack enhances observability across infrastructures.
- **Remote Reindexing Management**: Strategies for managing reindexing across clusters.
- **Cluster Migrations**: Handling the challenges of migrating Elasticsearch clusters across versions or setups.
- **Cluster Upgrades**: Safe upgrade paths for Elasticsearch clusters while maintaining data integrity.
